Lua scripts for shiny hunting in RBY games.

Work only with vba rr 23.6.

Thanks to zaksabeast for updating the scripts for 1.3 transporter update!

## Gift ##
DVs are generated after prompted to nickname your Pokémon.

Put the cursor over "no" (nicknames not yet supported) and run the script

Valid for: starters, fossils, in-game gifts (eevee, lapras, ...) and game corner prizes.

## Stationary ##
DVs are generated when the battle begins.

Interact with the sprite, stop at the cry text before the battle and run the script.

Valid for: Snorlax, Zapdos, Articuno, Moltres, Mewtwo, Electrode/Voltorb in Power Plant.

## Fishing ##

Species is generated first, and the IVs. Thanks Collector Togami for the info.

Edit the script for desidered species, editing index number.

Index numbers can be found here: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_index_number_(Generation_I)

Select your rod, put cursor over "use" and run the script. 

## Nature check ##

Rewritten Collector Togami's script with game version autocheck and more compact code.

This script (not a bot) will show on-screen what nature Pokémon will have (and shinyness) when transferred through PokéBank.

Nature is based on experience points, so gaining experience points will change nature.

## TID ##

Edit the script for desired TID, in decimal.

Run with the cursor over "New Game" in main screen.

## In game trade ##

Run the script before last input before animation (should be at text "connect your link cable" or something like that).

## wild (requires IPS patch) ##

To use with [patches](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonrng/comments/6e8kvm/ips_patches_pokemon_red_blue_with_fixed_rng_and/)
Thanks to Aligateur!
